# Contributing to PEModUtils

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project! My goal with this project is to help LUA scripters through:

* Providing code that is documented, optimized, and readable.
* Providing code that contains error-handling and easily understood error states.
* Providing resources that speed up mod development.

## Cloning

It's recommended to work in the experimental branch so that previous features are left untouched and that code behavior will stay the same for the end-user until they decide to update.

You can clone the experimental branch through the following git command:

```git
git clone -b experimental https://github.com/galactic2005/PEModUtils.git
```

Remember to also perform Pull Requests to the experimental branch as well!
