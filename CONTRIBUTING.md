# Contributing to PEModUtils

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project! My goal with this project is to help LUA scripters through:

* Providing code that is documented, optimized, and readable.
* Providing code that contains error-handling and easily understood error states.
* Providing resources that speed up mod development.

## Code

To keep code maintainable, optimized, and readable, a style guide is enforced. See [LUASTYLEGUIDE](Contributing/LUASTYLEGUIDE.md) for details.

## Documentation

To keep documentation clean and usable, a style guide is enforced. See [DOCSTYLEGUIDE](Contributing/DOCSTYLEGUIDE.md) for details.
